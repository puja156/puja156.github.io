          Let’s briefly see what happens when we use CNN on text data through a diagram.The result of each convolution will fire when a special pattern is detected. By varying the size of the kernels and concatenating their outputs, you’re allowing yourself to detect patterns of multiples sizes (2, 3, or 5 adjacent words).Patterns could be expressions (word ngrams?) like “I hate”, “very good” and therefore CNNs can identify them in the sentence regardless of their position.
